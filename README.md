# go-xbo
Package xbo is "yet another eXponential Back Off implementation".

It provides much of the same functionality as several of the other open
source implementations (https://github.com/cenkalti/backoff;
https://github.com/jpillora/backoff), but with an increased focus on
being composable, and to provide concurrency-safe options.
